# Battle Snake
This is a library and collection of snakes to the [battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com/) game.


## TODO:
* If node D is a decendent of node P, and node P is a decision node for snake i that has seen a solution to live for at least t turns, if node D has snake i as dead, and node D is at turn < t then return immediately.
* Change depth management to be based on "finge" nodes and just expand finge nodes until time runs out, rather than guessing and checking the depth.
